# Rock-Climbing-Preferences
This application gathers information on a user and displays a banner with 3 choices. Choice 1 displays the users rock climbing preferences back to them in a well formatted banner. As well as the average number of hours they spend rock climbing in a year. It then saves the report as a txt file named report.txt. Choice 2 will determine how advanced a user is and display an encouraging message. Choice 3 ends the program, thanks the user and says goodbye.
